# [The Painter's Partition Problem-II](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/the-painters-partition-problem1535/1)
## Hard
Given an array arr[] where each element denotes the length of a board, and an integer k representing the number of painters available. Each painter takes 1 unit of time to paint 1 unit length of a board.Determine the minimum amount of time required to paint all the boards, under the constraint that each painter can paint only a contiguous sequence of boards (no skipping or splitting allowed).Examples:Input: arr[] = [5, 10, 30, 20, 15], k = 3
Output: 35
Explanation: The optimal allocation of boards among 3 painters is - Painter 1 → [5, 10] → time = 15Painter 2 → [30] → time = 30Painter 3 → [20, 15] → time = 35Job will be done when all painters finish i.e. at time = max(15, 30, 35) = 35Input: arr[] = [10, 20, 30, 40], k = 2
Output: 60
Explanation: A valid optimal partition is - Painter 1 → [10, 20, 30] → time = 60Painter 2 → [40] → time = 40Job will be complete at time = max(60, 40) = 60Input: arr[] = [100, 200, 300, 400], k = 1
Output: 1000
Explanation: There is only one painter, so the painter must paint all boards sequentially. The total time taken will be the sum of all board lengths, i.e., 100 + 200 + 300 + 400 = 1000.
